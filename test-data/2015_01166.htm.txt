	 The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Lerone Grant, Appellant.





Leonard J. Levenson, New York, for appellant.

Lerone Grant, appellant pro se.



Judgment, Supreme Court, New York County (Renee A. White, J.), rendered on or
about September 11, 2012, unanimously affirmed.

Application by appellant's counsel to withdraw as counsel is granted (see Anders
v California, 386 US 738 [1967]; People v Saunders, 52 AD2d 833 [1st Dept
1976]). We have reviewed this record and agree with appellant's assigned counsel that
there are no nonfrivolous points which could be raised on this appeal.

Pursuant to Criminal Procedure Law § 460.20, defendant may apply for
leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals by making application to the Chief Judge of that
Court and by submitting such application to the Clerk of that Court or to a Justice of the
Appellate Division of the Supreme Court of this Department on reasonable notice to the
respondent within 30 days after service of a copy of this order.

Denial of the application for permission to appeal by the judge or justice first applied
to is final and no new application may thereafter be made to any other judge or
justice.

We have considered the contentions raised in defendant's pro se supplemental brief
and find them to be without merit. Concur—Tom, J.P., Friedman, Andrias,
DeGrasse and Gische, JJ.
