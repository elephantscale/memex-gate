	 Bausch & Lomb Contact Lens Solution Product
Liability Litigation.





Parker Waichman LLP, Port Washington (Jay L.T. Breakstone of counsel), for
appellants.

Heidell, Pittoni, Murphy & Bach, LLP, New York (Daniel S. Ratner of
counsel), for respondent.



Order, Supreme Court, New York County (Shirley Werner Kornreich, J.), entered
May 31, 2013, which, among other things, denied plaintiffs' motion to renew defendant's
pretrial motion to exclude certain expert opinions, unanimously affirmed, without
costs.

Even if the motion were timely, plaintiffs failed to show that the alleged new facts
would change the court's prior determination to exclude the general causation opinions of
plaintiffs' experts regarding non-Fusarium corneal infections (see CPLR 2221 [e]
[2]). In particular, plaintiffs failed to show that the experts' causation theory was
generally accepted by the relevant medical or scientific community (see Cornell v 360 W. 51st St.
Realty, LLC, 22 NY3d 762 [2014]; Matter of Bausch & Lomb Contact Lens Solution Prod. Liab.
Litig., 87 AD3d 913, 913 [1st Dept 2011], leave dismissed 19 NY3d 845
[2012]). The new studies submitted by [*2]plaintiffs do
not support the experts' causation theory.

We have considered plaintiffs' remaining contentions and find them unavailing.
Concur—Tom, J.P., Friedman, Andrias, DeGrasse and Gische, JJ.
