Appeal from an order of the Supreme Court, Oneida County (James P. McClusky,
J.), dated March 3, 2014. The order, insofar as appealed from, granted the motions of
defendants-respondents to preclude plaintiffs from introducing certain evidence at
trial.

It is hereby ordered that the order insofar as appealed from is unanimously reversed
on the law without costs and the motions are denied.

Memorandum: In this legal malpractice action, plaintiffs appeal from that part of an
order granting the motions of defendants-respondents (hereafter, defendants) to preclude
plaintiffs from introducing certain evidence at trial. We agree with plaintiffs that
Supreme Court erred in granting the motions, and we therefore reverse the order insofar
as appealed from.

This case has been before us on two prior occasions (Dischiavi v Calli
[appeal No. 2], 68 AD3d 1691 [2009] [Dischiavi I]; Dischiavi v Calli, 111 AD3d
1258 [2013] [Dischiavi II]), both involving, inter alia, the motions of various
defendants for summary judgment. In both appeals, at least some defendants sought
summary judgment dismissing the legal malpractice cause of action based upon the
expiration of the statute of limitations, and we rejected that contention in both prior
appeals. Specifically, in Dischiavi I, we concluded that, "[w]ith respect to the
legal malpractice cause of action, there is a triable issue of fact whether plaintiffs are
entitled to the toll provided by the continuous representation doctrine" (68 AD3d at
1694). Again in Dischiavi II, we affirmed that part of the order on appeal that
denied the various defendants' motions for [*2]summary
judgment on the ground "that plaintiffs raised a triable issue of fact whether the doctrine
of continuous representation tolled the statute of limitations" (111 AD3d at
1260-1261).

The matter progressed toward trial after this Court issued its decision in Dischiavi
II. In the order on appeal, the court granted defendants' motions to preclude plaintiffs
from introducing evidence that any of the defendants represented plaintiffs with respect
to any issue other than an issue in the context of a medical malpractice action against a
physician. The effect of that order was to limit plaintiffs to introducing evidence that, in
1994, one of the defendants made a statement to Gary M. Dischiavi (plaintiff) indicating
that the medical malpractice action was not viable.

We note at the outset that, although the parties do not address the appealability of
this order determining a motion in limine, we conclude that plaintiffs may appeal from
the order at issue (see Franklin
Corp. v Prahler, 91 AD3d 49, 54 [2011]). "Generally, an order ruling [on a
motion in limine], even when made in advance of trial on motion papers constitutes, at
best, an advisory opinion which is neither appealable as of right nor by permission" (Innovative Transmission &
Engine Co., LLC v Massaro, 63 AD3d 1506, 1507 [2009] [internal quotation
marks omitted]; see Scalp & Blade v Advest, Inc., 309 AD2d 219, 224
[2003]). This Court has noted, however, that "there is a distinction between an order that
'limits the admissibility of evidence,' which is not appealable . . . , and one
that 'limits the legal theories of liability to be tried' or the scope of the issues at trial,
which is appealable" (Scalp & Blade, 309 AD2d at 224). Here, the order
precluded the introduction of the vast majority of the evidence on the issue whether
defendants continued to represent plaintiffs so as to toll the statute of limitations, and
thus it is appealable because it limits the scope of the issues at trial (see generally O'Donnell v
Ferguson, 100 AD3d 1534, 1535-1536 [2012]; Catanese v Furman, 27 AD3d
1050, 1051 [2006]).

With respect to the substantive issue, we note that, after our determinations in
Dischiavi I and Dischiavi II that there was a triable issue of fact whether
the doctrine of continuous representation tolled the statute of limitations, the court
granted those parts of defendants' motions in limine seeking to preclude plaintiffs from
offering evidence to establish that there had been such representation. Although the court
has broad discretion to determine the admissibility of evidence, we agree with plaintiffs
that the court abused that discretion here. Defendants are correct that, "in the context of a
legal malpractice action, the continuous representation doctrine tolls the [s]tatute of
[l]imitations only where the continuing representation pertains specifically to the matter
in which the attorney committed the alleged malpractice" (Shumsky v Eisenstein,
96 NY2d 164, 168 [2001]). The continuous representation doctrine is derived from the
continuous treatment doctrine in medical malpractice cases (see Mercone v Monroe County
Deputy Sheriffs' Assn., Inc., 90 AD3d 1698, 1699 [2011]; Pollicino v
Roemer & Featherstonhaugh, 260 AD2d 52, 54 [1999]), however, and as the
Court of Appeals explained later in Shumsky, "[i]ncluded within the scope of
continuous treatment is a timely return visit instigated by the patient to complain about
and seek treatment for a matter related to the initial treatment" (id. at 170 [internal
quotation marks omitted]). Thus, the statute of limitations in a legal malpractice action is
tolled where, as here, a "defendant continuously represented the plaintiffs during [the
relevant] period by performing legal services related to the matter out of which the
malpractice claim arose" (Kuritzky v Sirlin & Sirlin, 231 AD2d 607, 608
[1996]).

Furthermore, in both prior appeals we concluded that there was a triable issue of fact
whether the statute of limitations was tolled because, in opposition to the various
defendants' motions for summary judgment, plaintiffs raised a triable issue of fact
whether one or more of the defendants continued to represent plaintiffs on a related
matter (Dischiavi I, 68 AD3d at 1694; Dischiavi II, 111 AD3d at
1260-1261). We reached that conclusion because, in opposition to defendants' motions
for summary judgment, plaintiffs "adduced persuasive evidence establishing that
[defendants] performed continuing legal services [throughout the time during which the
statute is alleged to have been tolled] to correct [their] alleged failure to effectively"
commence an action to recover damages for plaintiff's injuries (N&S Supply v
Simmons, 305 AD2d 648, 650 [2003]). Here, the evidence that defendants sought to
preclude was highly relevant to the issue whether the actions in question involved "an
attempt by the attorney to rectify an alleged act of malpractice" that would constitute
continuing representation sufficient to toll the statute of limitations (Luk Lamellen U.
Kupplungbau GmbH v Lerner, 166 AD2d 505, 506-507 [1990]; see Weiss v
Manfredi, 83 NY2d 974, 977 [1994], rearg denied 84 NY2d 848 [1994]; DeStaso v Condon Resnick,
LLP, 90 AD3d 809, 812-813 [2011]).
[*3]    Consequently, we reverse the order insofar as appealed
from and deny the motions. Present—Smith, J.P., Fahey, Whalen and DeJoseph,
