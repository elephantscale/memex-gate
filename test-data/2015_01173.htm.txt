	 Financial Structures Limited et al.,
Appellants,
v
UBS AG et al., Respondents.





Denton US LLP, New York (Michael H. Barr of counsel), for appellants.

Paul Hastings LLP, New York (James R. Bliss of counsel), for respondents.





Judgment, Supreme Court, New York County (Saliann Scarpulla, J.), entered April
11, 2014, dismissing plaintiffs' complaint pursuant to an order, same court and Justice,
entered April 9, 2014, which, insofar as appealed from as limited by the briefs, had
granted defendants' motion for summary judgment dismissing the complaint,
unanimously affirmed, with costs. Appeal from the aforesaid order, unanimously
dismissed, without costs, as subsumed in the appeal from the judgment.

The alleged oral representation made by one of defendants' representatives to one of
plaintiffs' representatives regarding defendants' management of the reference pools at
issue is insufficient to raise a triable issue of fact as to the existence of a legally binding
oral side agreement between the parties. The evidence, as a whole, including several
written agreements between the sophisticated commercial parties documenting the terms
of defendants' management obligations with no mention made of the alleged oral
representation, demonstrates the lack of an oral agreement (see Zheng v City of New York,
19 NY3d 556, 575 [2012]).

We have considered plaintiffs' remaining contentions and find them unavailing.
