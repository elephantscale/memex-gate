	 David H. Kernan et al., Respondents, v Trajanka
Williams, Appellant. (Appeal No. 2.)





D.J. & J.A. Cirando, Esqs., Syracuse (John A. Cirando of counsel), for
defendant-appellant.

Conboy, McKay, Bachman & Kendall, LLP, Watertown (Stephen W. Gebo of
counsel), for plaintiffs-respondents.





Appeal from a judgment of the Supreme Court, Jefferson County (Hugh A. Gilbert,
J.), entered February 19, 2013. The judgment declared the rights of the parties with
respect to certain underwater land in North Bay.

It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously modified on
the law by vacating the first decretal paragraph and the phrase "interference with the
plaintiffs' ownership rights" in the third decretal paragraph and as modified the judgment
is affirmed without costs in accordance with the following memorandum: Plaintiffs
commenced this action pursuant to RPAPL article 15 seeking, inter alia, a declaration
that plaintiffs own the underwater land in North Bay, as owners of the adjacent upland
property on Carleton Island in the Town of Cape Vincent. According to plaintiffs,
defendant improperly directed them to remove a water pipe that was allegedly intruding
on defendant's underwater land in North Bay inasmuch as the quitclaim deed purporting
to grant defendant ownership to the underwater property in North Bay and South Bay is a
nullity. Plaintiffs thereafter moved for summary judgment, seeking a declaration that
defendant has no ownership interest in any underwater land in North Bay or South Bay,
and seeking to enjoin defendant from entering plaintiffs' property. Supreme Court
granted plaintiffs' motion and denied as moot defendant's cross motion, in which
defendant sought to add necessary parties pursuant to CPLR 1001. This appeal by
defendant ensued.

We reject defendant's contention that the court erred in granting plaintiffs' motion,
although we note that the court granted relief to plaintiffs beyond that requested in their
motion papers by concluding that plaintiffs owned the underwater land adjacent to their
upland in North Bay. Indeed, plaintiffs expressly stated in support of their motion that
"[t]hey do not seek, or need, any determination by the Court of the extent of their
underwater rights or where they might end." We therefore modify the judgment by
vacating the first decretal paragraph and the phrase "interference with the plaintiffs'
ownership rights" in the third decretal paragraph, so that such paragraph reads, "The
conduct of defendant in denying plaintiffs the right to use underwater land in North Bay
adjacent to the plaintiffs' adjoining upland property was and still is wrongful and
unlawful."

Contrary to defendant's initial contention, the court properly considered the deeds
submitted by plaintiffs in support of their motion. All of those deeds, with the exception
of defendant's own quitclaim deed, are more than 10 years old and therefore are "prima
facie evidence of their contents" (CPLR 4522; see Bergstrom v McChesney, 92 AD3d 1125, 1126
[2012]; Town of Skaneateles v Lang, 179 AD2d 1032, 1032 [1992]). With
respect to defendant's quitclaim deed, plaintiffs' attorney swore to its authenticity (see
generally Sloninski v Weston, 232 AD2d 913, 914 [1996], lv denied 89
NY2d 809 [1997], rearg denied 89 NY2d 1086 [1997]), and defendant herself
relies on [*2]that deed in opposition to plaintiffs'
motion.

With respect to the merits, even with navigable waterways, "when land under water
has been conveyed by the state to the owner of the adjacent uplands, the lands under
water so conveyed become appurtenant to the uplands, and will pass by a conveyance of
the latter without specific description" (Archibald v New York Cent. & Hudson
Riv. R.R. Co., 157 NY 574, 579 [1899]; see Matter of City of New York [W.
10th St. Realty Corp.], 256 NY 222, 224-226 [1931]; Smith v Bartlett, 180
NY 360, 362, 366 [1905]). Here, regardless of whether title to the underwater land
merges and passes with title to adjacent uplands, or is conveyed separately, plaintiffs met
their initial burden. Although the State initially conveyed uplands and underwater land to
Charles Smyth by separate deeds, the underwater land thereafter passed appurtenant to
Smyth's uplands, including by deeds to plaintiffs and several other landowners on North
Bay, but not to defendant. Even if the underwater land could be conveyed only
separately, it would have passed to Smyth's heirs and devisees, not directly to
defendant.

In opposition, defendant failed to raise a triable issue of fact (see generally
Zuckerman v City of New York, 49 NY2d 557, 562 [1980]). Although there were
discrepancies in both plaintiffs' and defendant's chains of title, including allegations as to
Smyth's identity, defendant has failed to submit evidence establishing or, indeed, even to
allege, that she owned uplands adjacent to the underwater land at issue or that she
acquired title to the land through a chain of title tracing back to an heir or devisee of the
original grantee of the underwater land.

Finally, we conclude that defendant is not entitled to the relief sought in her cross
motion, i.e., to add necessary parties pursuant to CPLR 1001. We are not determining
herein which owners of uplands have title to the underwater land at issue, and thus the
other landowners, the allegedly necessary parties, cannot be "inequitably affected" by our
decision (CPLR 1001 [a]; see generally Matter of Castaways Motel v Schuyler,
24 NY2d 120, 125 [1969], adhered to on rearg 25 NY2d 692 [1969]; cf. Halfond v White Lake Shores
Assn., Inc., 114 AD3d 1315, 1318 [2014]). Present—Smith, J.P., Fahey,
Whalen and DeJoseph, JJ.
