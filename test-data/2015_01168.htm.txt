	 The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Peter Kaplan, Appellant.





Michael A. Scotto, Garden City, for appellant.

Cyrus R. Vance, Jr., District Attorney, New York (Grace Vee of counsel), for
respondent.





Judgment, Supreme Court, New York County (Daniel P. FitzGerald, J.), rendered on
or about June 23, 2014, convicting defendant, after a nonjury trial, of attempted criminal
contempt in the second degree, and sentencing him to a term of 20 days, concurrent with
one year of probation, and imposing a final order of protection, unanimously modified,
on the law, to the extent of remanding for resentencing proceedings consistent with this
decision, and otherwise affirmed.

The misdemeanor accusatory instrument in this Integrated Domestic Violence Part
case was facially sufficient. In pertinent part, it alleged that, in a recorded phone call,
defendant attempted to contact his wife through a third party in violation of an order of
protection. These allegations gave defendant sufficient notice to prepare a defense and
had detail adequate to prevent him from being tried twice for the same offense (see People v Kalin, 12 NY3d
225 [2009]). The instrument alleged conduct that came dangerously close to
completion of a crime, and thus sufficiently alleged an attempted crime. Defendant's
remaining claims regarding the instrument are without merit.

The court's verdict was based on legally sufficient evidence and was not against the
weight of the evidence (see
People v Danielson, 9 NY3d 342, 348-349 [2007]). The evidence supported an
inference that defendant knowingly and intentionally violated the provision of an order
of protection barring any third-party contact with his wife. The evidence established
attempted contempt, because the crime would have been complete had the third party
complied with defendant's request. Defendant's claim that the attempted contact was
justified as an emergency measure under Penal Law § 35.05 (2) is
meritless.

Because defendant was convicted after trial of a misdemeanor, probation was not an
agreed-upon sentence (see CPL 390.20 [4] [a] [ii]). Accordingly, a sentence of
probation was not authorized without a presentence report, and a remand is required for
resentencing in compliance with CPL 390.20 (2) (a). In addition, as the People concede,
the final order of protection should be reduced from five years to two years (see
CPL 530.12 [5] [c]). Upon resentencing, that error should be corrected as
well.
[*2] We have considered and rejected
defendant's remaining claims, including his challenges to the admissibility of a recorded
phone call he made while in custody awaiting arraignment on other charges.
Concur—Tom, J.P., Friedman, Andrias, DeGrasse and Gische, JJ.
