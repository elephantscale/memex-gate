	 The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v
Tito Roosevelt, Also Known as Samuel Gamblin, Appellant. (Appeal No.
1.)





The Legal Aid Bureau of Buffalo, Inc., Buffalo (David J. Rudroff of counsel), for
defendant-appellant.

Frank A. Sedita, III, District Attorney, Buffalo (Matthew B. Powers of counsel), for
respondent.





Appeal from a judgment of the Erie County Court (Michael F. Pietruszka, J.),
rendered March 18, 2013. The judgment convicted defendant, upon a jury verdict, of
criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree, forgery in the second degree and
false personation.

It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously
affirmed.

Memorandum: In appeal No. 1, defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him
following a jury trial of, inter alia, criminal possession of a weapon in the second degree
(Penal Law § 265.03 [3]) and, in appeal No. 2, he appeals from a judgment
convicting him upon his plea of guilty of promoting prison contraband in the first degree
(§ 205.25 [2]). In appeal No. 1, defendant contends that reversal is required
because County Court erred in refusing to suppress statements he made to the police
following his arrest on the weapons offense. We reject defendant's contention that
reversal is required. According to the evidence at the suppression hearing, a police
officer on patrol with his partner in the City of Buffalo observed defendant standing in
the doorway of a corner store looking outside and from side to side. The officer testified
that, when defendant made eye contact with him, defendant's eyes "got big" and he ran
toward the rear of the store. The officer and his partner exited their vehicle and, upon
entering the store, they encountered defendant, who was on his way out. Defendant was
sweating and appeared to be nervous. The officer directed a third officer to detain
defendant outside while he and his partner searched the store for guns or drugs. Within
minutes, the officer found a loaded .38 caliber handgun in a cardboard box that contained
gallon jugs of water. The box was on the shelf of the aisle where the officer had seen
defendant walking as he headed for the exit. The officer and his partner then reviewed
the store's surveillance video, which showed defendant placing an object into the box in
question minutes earlier. After viewing the video, the officer sent a radio message to the
third officer directing him to arrest defendant.

At the police station, defendant waived his Miranda rights and admitted that
he possessed the gun, explaining that he intended to use the gun to shoot a man in the
store who had shot his brother. In seeking to suppress his statements to the police but not
the weapon itself, defendant contended that he was unlawfully detained outside the store
before the police discovered the weapon and that his statements therefore constituted
fruit of the poisonous tree.

We agree with defendant that the police unlawfully detained him outside the store
while they searched inside for contraband, inasmuch as, at that time, there did not exist
reasonable suspicion to believe that he was committing, had committed or was about to
commit a crime (see generally
People v Moore, 6 NY3d 496, 498-499 [2006]; People v De Bour, 40
NY2d 210, 223 [1976]). Defendant's behavior in the store as observed by the officer
justified, at most, a level two common-law inquiry. The People assert that, once the
police independently found the loaded [*2]weapon in the
store approximately five minutes after defendant was initially detained, the degree of
suspicion ripened to probable cause, and defendant was lawfully arrested. Thus, the
People conclude, there is no basis to suppress defendant's subsequent statements as the
product of an unlawful arrest (see People v Stevenson, 273 AD2d 826, 827
[2000]). Because the suppression court did not rely on that ground in denying defendant's
motion, however, we cannot affirm on that basis (see People v Concepcion, 17 NY3d 192, 197-198
[2011]).

Nevertheless, we conclude that any error in failing to suppress defendant's statements
is harmless inasmuch as the proof of guilt is overwhelming and there is no reasonable
possibility that the jury would have acquitted defendant if his statements had been
suppressed (see People v
Brown, 120 AD3d 954 [2014]; see generally People v Crimmins, 36
NY2d 230, 237 [1975]). The store surveillance video clearly showed defendant place an
object into the box in which the loaded firearm was found minutes later by the police.
Although one cannot discern from the video that the object that defendant placed into the
box was a gun—defendant suggests on appeal that it could have been a cell
phone—the box contained no objects other than the gun and the jugs of water.
Moreover, the evidence at trial showed that defendant could not be excluded as a
contributor to DNA recovered from the gun. According to the People's DNA expert, the
probability of randomly selecting an unrelated person as a possible contributor to the
DNA profile was at least one in 995 for individuals in the United States.

We reject defendant's further contention in appeal No. 1 that the evidence is legally
insufficient to support the conviction of the weapons offense. Viewing the evidence in
the light most favorable to the People (see People v Contes, 60 NY2d 620, 621
[1983]), we conclude that there is a valid line of reasoning and permissible inferences
that could lead a rational person to conclude that defendant possessed a loaded and
operable firearm (see generally People v Bleakley, 69 NY2d 490, 495 [1987]).
Further, viewing the evidence in light of the elements of that crime as charged to the jury
(see People v Danielson, 9
NY3d 342, 349 [2007]), we conclude that the verdict is not against the weight of the
evidence (see generally Bleakley, 69 NY2d at 495).

We have reviewed defendant's remaining contentions in appeal No. 1 and conclude
that none require reversal or modification of the judgment. Finally, in view of our
determination affirming the judgment in appeal No. 1, there is no basis to grant his
request to reverse the judgment in appeal No. 2 and vacate his plea of guilty (cf.
People v Fuggazzatto, 62 NY2d 862, 863 [1984]). Present—Centra, J.P.,
Fahey, Lindley, Sconiers and Whalen, JJ.
