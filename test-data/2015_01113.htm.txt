	 The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v
Mark Daniels, Appellant.





The Legal Aid Bureau of Buffalo, Inc., Buffalo (Robert L. Kemp of counsel), for
defendant-appellant.

Frank A. Sedita, III, District Attorney, Buffalo (Nicholas T. Texido of counsel), for
respondent.





Appeal from a judgment of the Erie County Court (Michael L. D'Amico, J.),
rendered January 18, 2013. The judgment convicted defendant, upon a nonjury verdict,
of robbery in the second degree (two counts), grand larceny in the third degree and
reckless driving.

It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously modified on
the law by vacating the sentence imposed on count four of the indictment and imposing a
definite sentence of 30 days' imprisonment on that count, to run concurrently with the
sentences imposed on counts one, two, and three, and as modified the judgment is
affirmed.

Memorandum: Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him upon a nonjury
verdict of two counts of robbery in the second degree (Penal Law § 160.10
[2] [a]), and one count each of grand larceny in the third degree (§ 155.35
[1]) and reckless driving (Vehicle and Traffic Law § 1212), in connection
with a bank robbery and the flight therefrom, which resulted in injuries to two innocent
civilians.

We reject defendant's contention that the evidence is legally insufficient to support
the robbery and grand larceny convictions. Viewing the evidence in the light most
favorable to the People (see People v Contes, 60 NY2d 620, 621 [1983]), we
conclude that there is a valid line of reasoning and permissible inferences that could lead
the court in this nonjury trial to find that defendant forcibly stole money in excess of
$3,000 from the bank. "Although the employees of the bank robbed by defendant
. . . could not specifically identify defendant, the element of identity was
established by a compelling chain of circumstantial evidence that had no reasonable
explanation except that defendant was . . . the perpetrator[ ]" (People v Brown, 92 AD3d
1216, 1217 [2012], lv denied 18 NY3d 992 [2012]). That evidence included
the stolen GPS unit and prerecorded bait money in defendant's bag that he dropped when
apprehended by the police, clothing removed from defendant at the hospital that matched
the bank employees' descriptions, and the presence of defendant's DNA on clothing
found in the middle of defendant's route in fleeing from the bank. Furthermore, viewing
the evidence in the light of the elements of the crimes in this nonjury trial (see People v Danielson, 9
NY3d 342, 349 [2007]), we reject defendant's contention that the verdict is against
the weight of the evidence with respect to the robbery and grand larceny convictions
(see generally People v Bleakley, 69 NY2d 490, 495 [1987]; People v Kirton, 36 AD3d
1011, 1013-1014 [2007], lv denied 8 NY3d 947 [2007]).

Finally, although not raised by defendant, we note that the sentence imposed on
count four of the indictment, i.e., a one-year definite term of imprisonment for reckless
driving, an unclassified misdemeanor, is illegal (see Vehicle and Traffic Law
§ 1801 [1]; Penal Law § 70.15 [3]), and we cannot allow that
illegal sentence to stand (see
generally People v VanValkinburgh, 90 AD3d 1553, 1554 [2011]). "In the
interest of judicial economy, we exercise our inherent authority to correct the illegal
sentence" (People v Perrin,
94 AD3d 1551, 1551 [2012]). We therefore modify the judgment by vacating the
sentence imposed on count four and imposing a definite sentence of 30 [*2]days' imprisonment on that count, to run concurrently with
the sentences imposed on the remaining counts of the indictment (Vehicle and Traffic
Law § 1801 [1]). We otherwise conclude that the sentences imposed on the
remaining counts are not unduly harsh or severe. Present—Smith, J.P., Fahey,
Whalen and DeJoseph, JJ.
