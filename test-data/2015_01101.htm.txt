	 In the Matter of Techniplex III, a Partnership,
Respondent, v Town and Village of East Rochester, Appellants. (Appeal No.
1.)





Lacy Katzen LLP, Rochester (John T. Refermat of counsel), for
respondents-appellants.

Ward Greenberg Heller & Reidy LLP, Rochester (Daniel P. Purcell of counsel),
for petitioner-respondent.





Appeal from an order of the Supreme Court, Monroe County (Matthew A.
Rosenbaum, J.), entered October 24, 2013 in a proceeding pursuant to RPTL article 7.
The order, among other things, granted the petitions in part and ordered respondents to
correct the assessment rolls and to refund the tax overpayments with interest.

It is hereby ordered that the order so appealed from is unanimously affirmed without
costs.

Memorandum: Petitioners, related commercial entities with common ownership,
commenced these RPTL article 7 proceedings seeking review of the real property tax
assessments for three commercial properties located in respondents Town and Village of
East Rochester for the tax years 2009, 2010, and 2011. In each of the appeals,
respondents appeal from an order granting the respective petitions in part and ordering
respondents to correct the assessment rolls and to refund the tax overpayments with
interest. We affirm the orders in each appeal.

Contrary to the contention of respondents in all three appeals, we conclude that
petitioners met their initial burden of presenting "substantial evidence that the propert[ies
were] overvalued" (Matter of
Roth v City of Syracuse, 21 NY3d 411, 417 [2013]), thereby rebutting the
"presumption of validity [that] attaches to the valuation of property made by the taxing
authority" (id.; see
Matter of Board of Mgrs. of French Oaks Condominium v Town of Amherst, 23
NY3d 168, 174-175 [2014]). "In the context of tax assessment cases, the 'substantial
evidence' standard merely requires that petitioner demonstrate the existence of a valid
and credible dispute regarding valuation" (Matter of FMC Corp. [Peroxygen Chems.
Div.] v Unmack, 92 NY2d 179, 188 [1998]; see Matter of East Med. Ctr., L.P. v Assessor of Town of
Manlius, 16 AD3d 1119, 1120 [2005]). "The ultimate strength, credibility or
persuasiveness of petitioner's arguments are not germane during this threshold inquiry"
(FMC Corp., 92 NY2d at 188; see Matter of W.O.R.C. Realty Corp. v Board of Assessors, 100
AD3d 75, 88 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 862 [2013]). Here, petitioners
submitted appraisals by a qualified expert who valued the subject properties utilizing the
income capitalization approach to valuation, which is "generally regarded as the
preferred method for determining the value of income-producing propert[ies]" such as
those at issue in this case (41 Kew Gardens Rd. Assoc. v Tyburski, 70 NY2d 325,
331 [1987]; see Matter of OCG
L.P. v Board of Assessment Review of the Town of Owego, 79 AD3d 1224,
1226 [2010]). Further, the appraisals "contained documentation and calculations to
support the underlying methodolog[y] and the ultimate valuation" (Matter of United Parcel Serv. v
Assessor of Town of Colonie, 42 AD3d 835, 838 [2007]; see 22
NYCRR 202.59 [g] [2]). "The fact that some aspects of [the expert]'s valuation
methodology may be subject to question goes to the weight to be accorded the
appraisal[s] and [*2]not to 'the threshold issue of whether
petitioner[s] produced substantial evidence to rebut the presumption of validity' "
(OCG L.P., 79 AD3d at 1226; see FMC Corp., 92 NY2d at
187-188).

We further conclude with respect to all three appeals that petitioners met their
ultimate burden of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence that the three
properties were overvalued and thus that the challenged assessments were excessive
(see generally Board of Mgrs. of French Oaks Condominium, 23 NY3d at
174-175; FMC Corp., 92 NY2d at 188). Contrary to respondents' contention,
Supreme Court did not err in relying upon actual rents rather than market rents in
determining the value of the subject properties (see Matter of Conifer Baldwinsville
Assoc. v Town of Van Buren, 68 NY2d 783, 785 [1986]). It is well established that
"valuation [is] largely a question of fact, and the [trial] courts have considerable
discretion in reviewing the relevant evidence as to the specific propert[ies] before them"
(Matter of Consolidated Edison
Co. of N.Y., Inc. v City of New York, 8 NY3d 591, 597 [2007]). "As a general
rule, actual rental income is often the best indicator of value" (Matter of Schoeneck v
City of Syracuse, 93 AD2d 988, 988 [1983], citing Matter of Merrick Holding
Corp. v Board of Assessors of County of Nassau, 45 NY2d 538, 543 [1978]),
although actual income " 'may be disregarded where it does not reflect full
value' " (Matter of North Country Hous. v Board of Assessment Review for
Vil. of Potsdam, 298 AD2d 667, 668 [2002]; see Merrick Holding Corp., 45
NY2d at 543; Matter of Schachenmayr v Board of Assessors of Town of N. Elba,
263 AD2d 731, 734 [1999]). Here, there is no evidence that the rents petitioners charged
were arbitrary or the result of collusion or self-dealing (see Merrick Holding
Corp., 45 NY2d at 543; North Country Hous., 298 AD2d at 668-669), and
respondents "failed to establish that the actual income was not reflective of the market
for the years under review" (Matter of County Dollar Corp. v City of Yonkers, 97
AD2d 469, 475 [1983], lv dismissed 61 NY2d 603 [1984], rearg denied
61 NY2d 905 [1984]; see Matter of Troy Realty Assoc. v Board of Assessors of City
of Troy, 227 AD2d 813, 814 [1996]).

In addition to their general objection to the use of actual as opposed to market rents,
respondents object to the valuation of two specific leased spaces at issue in appeal Nos. 1
and 2. In appeal No. 1, respondents contend that the court undervalued the subject
property (Techniplex III) because it did not assign a market value to the restaurant
located on the property. We reject that contention. The restaurant is operated by Tim
Donut U.S. Limited (Tim Donut) pursuant to a 30-year ground lease with petitioners.
During the tax years at issue, Tim Donut leased the land underlying the restaurant for
$30,000 per year. Tim Donut owned the restaurant and therefore paid no rent for the
building itself. Nevertheless, respondents' appraiser valued Techniplex III by estimating
what the market rent would be if petitioners were leasing both the land and the building.
He did so by comparing the rents paid by other fast-food restaurants "where[ ] the land
and buildings are leased in their entirety."

"The ultimate purpose of valuation . . . is to arrive at a fair and realistic
value of the property involved" (Matter of Allied Corp. v Town of Camillus, 80
NY2d 351, 356 [1992], rearg denied 81 NY2d 784 [1993]; see Matter of
Commerce Holding Corp. v Board of Assessors of Town of Babylon, 88 NY2d 724,
729 [1996]). The income capitalization approach to valuation "rests on the proposition
that the value of income-producing property is the amount a willing buyer, desiring but
not compelled to purchase it as an investment, would be prepared to pay for it under
ordinary conditions to a seller who desires, but is not compelled, to sell . . .
That amount will depend on the net income the property will likely produce inasmuch as
the purchase price represents the present worth of anticipated future benefits" (Matter of Hempstead Country Club
v Board of Assessors, 112 AD3d 123, 136 [2013] [internal quotation marks
omitted]). Here, the " 'net income the property will likely produce' "
(id.), at least for the next 30 years, is the amount of the ground lease. We
therefore conclude that the court did not abuse its discretion in valuing the property
based upon the ground lease payments rather than the theoretical market value of the land
and building leased as a unit (see generally Commerce Holding Corp., 88 NY2d
at 729; Matter of Alexander's Dept. Store of Val. Stream v Board of Assessors,
227 AD2d 549, 549-550 [1996]).

We likewise reject respondents' contention in appeal No. 2 that the court undervalued
the subject property (Techniplex I) because it failed to assign a market value to space
leased by Excellus BlueCross BlueShield (Excellus). During the tax years at issue,
Excellus was the property's largest tenant, occupying some 53,000 square feet on the first
floor of the building and 16,000 square feet on the second floor of the building. Excellus
leased the second floor space "rent free," paying only its proportionate share of the
associated operating expenses and real [*3]estate taxes.
Contrary to respondents' contention, the record establishes that the actual rent petitioners
received from Excellus was reflective of the market value of the leased space during the
tax years at issue. Petitioners' property manager testified that the East Rochester
commercial market is "very challenging" and less attractive to tenants than other Monroe
County suburbs. Petitioners' appraiser similarly testified that East Rochester was in a
"transitioning to decline phase," with a shrinking population base, the lowest median
home prices in suburban Monroe County, and no major commercial or industrial
development in two decades.

Petitioners' property manager further testified that Techniplex I presented additional
challenges in securing tenants. The building was originally developed as a retail mall in
the early 1970s and was thereafter converted to commercial office space with minimal
exterior windows and door access. As a result, the property manager testified that
petitioners have had to make "considerable concessions" to induce tenants to lease space
in Techniplex I, including free or reduced rent and subsidized tenant improvements.
After a long-term tenant vacated the property in mid-2004, Techniplex I remained largely
vacant until September 2005, when Excellus moved in. Petitioners ultimately offered
Excellus the second floor space rent free in order to induce it to lease space in
Techniplex I. Inasmuch as the record establishes that the lease "result[ed] from arm's
length bargaining carried out in good faith," we conclude that the court did not err in
using the actual rent received from Excellus in determining the valuation of Techniplex I
(Merrick Holding Corp., 45 NY2d at 543; see Alexander's Dept. Store of Val.
Stream, 227 AD2d at 549-550; County Dollar Corp., 97 AD2d at 473).

We have considered respondents' remaining contentions and conclude that they are
without merit. Present—Smith, J.P., Peradotto, Carni, Valentino and DeJoseph,
JJ.
