	 The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Rafael Rodriguez, Appellant.





Scott Rosenberg, The Legal Aid Society, New York (Allen Fallek of counsel), for
appellant.

Cyrus R. Vance, Jr., District Attorney, New York (Martin J. Foncello of counsel), for
respondent.





Judgment, Supreme Court, New York County (A. Kirke Bartley, Jr., J.), rendered on
or about September 28, 2011, convicting defendant, after a jury trial, of grand larceny in
the fourth degree and criminal possession of stolen property in the fifth degree, and
sentencing him, as a second felony offender, to an aggregate term of 2 to 4 years,
unanimously affirmed.

The verdict was based on legally sufficient evidence and was not against the weight
of the evidence (see People v
Danielson, 9 NY3d 342, 348-349 [2007). There is no basis for disturbing the
jury's credibility determinations. The evidence established that defendant took the
victim's property by reaching into her pocket, and the alternative scenario posited by
defendant is speculative and unsupported by any evidence.

Defendant's belated mistrial motion did not preserve his claim regarding the court's
failure to instruct the deliberating jurors pursuant to CPL 270.40 and 310.10 before
releasing them for lunch. The record does not support defendant's assertion that he was
prevented from raising the issue at a time when the error could have been avoided. We
decline to review this unpreserved issue in the interest of justice. As an alternative
holding, we find no basis for reversal (see CPL 470.05 [1]). The court properly
exercised its discretion in denying defendant's mistrial motion, particularly because it had
already given the jury instructions, throughout the [*2]trial, that adequately conveyed the necessary admonitions
(see People v Williams, 46
AD3d 585 [2d Dept 2007], lv denied 10 NY3d 772 [2008]). Furthermore,
defendant would not accept any remedy other than a mistrial. Concur—Sweeny,
J.P., Renwick, Moskowitz, Feinman and Kapnick, JJ.
