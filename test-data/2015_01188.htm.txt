	 The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Richee Ortega, Appellant.





Scott A. Rosenberg, The Legal Aid Society, New York (Kristina Schwarz of
counsel), for appellant.

Cyrus R. Vance, Jr., District Attorney, New York (Alan Gadlin of counsel), for
respondent.



Judgment, Supreme Court, New York County (Cassandra M. Mullen, J., at plea;
Michael R. Sonberg, J., at sentencing), rendered September 6, 2012, convicting
defendant of criminal possession of a controlled substance in the third degree (two
counts) and criminal possession of a controlled substance in the fifth degree, and
sentencing him to concurrent terms of six months, unanimously affirmed.

Defendant's challenge to the sufficiency of his plea is unpreserved (see
People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662, 665 [1988]), and we decline to review it in the
interest of justice. We reject defendant's assertion that he had no actual or practical ability
to make a motion to withdraw his plea. As an alternative holding, we reject the claim on
the merits.

Under the circumstances of this case, we find that the court adequately informed
defendant of the rights he would be waiving in exchange for his plea, and that the plea
was knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily made. There is no mandatory catechism for
a guilty plea, and a plea is not rendered invalid where "the record as a whole
. . . contain[s] an affirmative demonstration of the defendant's waiver of his
fundamental constitutional rights" (People v Tyrell, 22 NY3d 359, 366 [2013]).
