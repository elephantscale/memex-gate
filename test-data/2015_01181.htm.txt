	 In the Matter of Darren Gittens,
Appellant,
v
State University of New York et al.,
Respondents.





Civil Service Employees Association, Albany (Constance R. Brown of counsel), for
appellant.

Eric T. Schneiderman, Attorney General, New York (David Lawrence III of
counsel), for respondents.





Judgment, Supreme Court, New York County (Carol E. Huff, J.), entered April 14,
2014, denying a CPLR article 78 petition seeking to annul respondents' determination,
dated February 22, 2013, to terminate petitioner's employment, and granting respondents'
cross motion to deny the petition and dismiss the proceeding, unanimously reversed, on
the law, without costs, the judgment vacated, the cross motion denied, the petition
reinstated and the matter remanded for further proceedings.

The Supreme Court erred in holding that the parties' disciplinary settlement
agreement executed in 2012 waived petitioner's right to appeal or seek judicial review of
his termination of employment in all scenarios. The agreement's introductory paragraph
states that the parties agreed to settle petitioner's violation of a prior agreement where
petitioner, who had worked as a cleaner for respondents' hospital since 2003, sold a DVD
movie to the visitor of a patient in violation of SUNY DMC policy HR-03 entitled "Sales
of Goods and Services in Hospital," and which also violated departmental policies and
procedures. Paragraph one of the 2012 settlement agreement provided that should
petitioner engage in misconduct that was the "same or similar to" that constituting the
violation of the prior agreement, to be determined solely by the Director of Labor
Relations or her designee, he would be terminated and could not appeal the penalty in
any administrative or legal forum. However, paragraph three of the agreement separately
provided that petitioner agreed to adhere to departmental policies and procedures and
would be terminated for his failure to do so, but provided no limitation on who would
determine his guilt, nor did it waive any judicial review.

It is a cardinal rule of construction that courts should "adopt an interpretation that
renders no portion of the contract meaningless" (Matter of Wallace v 600 Partners
Co., 205 AD2d 202, 206 [1st Dept 1994], affd 86 NY2d 543 [1995]). In the
instant matter, respondents terminated petitioner for allegedly taking leave under the
Family and Medical Leave Act (see 29 USC § 2611 et seq.)
to care for his ill mother overseas without obtaining prior approval from his department
or the Office of Labor Relations. This is not conduct that is the "same or similar to" the
sale of goods to a visitor on hospital premises, and hence the strictures of paragraph one
of the 2012 settlement agreement, including the waiver of judicial review, are
inapplicable. To hold [*2]otherwise would be to render
superfluous paragraph three, which speaks to the penalty for failing to adhere to policies
and procedures generally, but does not include such additional restrictions (see Glass v Glass, 16 AD3d
120, 121 [1st Dept 2005]; Wallace at 206).

Moreover, respondents failed to follow their own procedures and the terms of the
settlement agreement by effectively precluding petitioner from having an opportunity to
explain why he should not be terminated.

As the Supreme Court never reached the merits of the petition, we remand for further
proceedings. Concur—Sweeny, J.P., Renwick, Moskowitz, Feinman and Kapnick,
JJ. [Prior Case History: 2014 NY Slip Op 30915(U).]
