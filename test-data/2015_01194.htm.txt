	 The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v
Jamie Monroe, Appellant.





John P.M. Wappett, Public Defender, Lake George (Nellie R. Halloran of counsel),
for appellant.

Kathleen B. Hogan, District Attorney, Lake George (Emilee B. Davenport of
counsel), for respondent.





McCarthy, J.P. Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of Warren County (Hall
Jr., J.), rendered August 15, 2012, convicting defendant upon her plea of guilty of the
crime of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree.

In full satisfaction of a three-count indictment, defendant pleaded guilty to a single
count of criminal sale of a controlled substance in the third degree and waived her right
to appeal. County Court indicated that it would consider whether to order substance
abuse treatment after reviewing the presentence investigation report, but did not promise
that treatment would be ordered. Thereafter, the court sentenced defendant, a second
felony offender, to a prison term of four years to be followed by three years of
postrelease supervision. The court declined defendant's request to order substance abuse
treatment, noting that defendant had failed in several prior treatment programs.
Defendant appeals.

Defendant's valid waiver of the right to appeal, which she does not challenge, bars
her claims that her sentence was harsh and excessive, and that County Court should have
directed further substance abuse treatment (see People v Borst, 121 AD3d 1424, 1425 [2014]; People v Smith, 112 AD3d
1232, 1232 [2013], lv denied 22 NY3d 1203 [2014]). Similarly, that waiver
bars her claim of ineffective assistance of counsel inasmuch as she does not contend that
the alleged ineffective assistance impacted the voluntariness of her plea (see People v
Livziey, 117 [*2]AD3d 1341, 1342 [2014]; People v Slingerland, 101
AD3d 1265, 1267 [2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 1104 [2013]).

Lynch, Devine and Clark, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is affirmed.
