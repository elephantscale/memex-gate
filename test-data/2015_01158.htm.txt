	 WSC Riverside Drive Owners LLC,
Respondent,
v
Oliver Williams, Appellant.





Grad & Weinraub, LLP, New York (Catharine A. Grad of counsel), for
appellant.

Sperber Denenberg & Kahan, P.C., New York (Steven B. Sperber of counsel),
for respondent.





Order of the Appellate Term of the Supreme Court, First Department, entered
December 19, 2013, which reversed an order of the Civil Court, New York County
(Sabrina B. Kraus, J.), entered on or about May 30, 2012, and, upon reversal, granted
landlord's holdover petition seeking denial of respondent's succession to a rent controlled
tenancy, unanimously reversed, on the law and the facts, without costs, the petition
denied, and the proceeding dismissed. The Clerk is directed to enter judgment
accordingly.

The evidence presented to the trial court amply supported its conclusion that
respondent's relationship with the now deceased tenant of record, Ms. Singer, was that of
a family member entitled to succeed Singer's rent controlled tenancy pursuant to 9
NYCRR 2204.6 (d) (3). Respondent lived with Singer for eight years prior to her death.
The two relied upon each other for payment of household expenses. They shared
holidays and birthday celebrations, traveled together for summer and weekend vacations
and traditionally ate their meals together in the subject apartment. The trial court credited
the testimony of friends and neighbors who described respondent and Singer as a couple
that some believed or assumed were married. Further, respondent and Singer took care of
each other. Notably, during the last two years of Singer's life, respondent spent
substantial time caring for her as she struggled with depression and bouts of colitis.
Hospital records listed respondent as Singer's "partner" and he signed consent forms for
her as a "personal representative."

While respondent and Singer maintained separate bank accounts and credit cards,
they owned an apartment together and relied on each other to pay expenses wherein
respondent paid for household expenses such as groceries, supplies and the rent when
Singer was unable to pay due to debilitating depression. As such, the modest
intermingling of finances does not negate the conclusion that Singer and respondent had
a family-like relationship. It is important to note that in considering whether a person
may be considered a "family member" for the purpose of succession, "no single factor
shall be solely determinative" (9 NYCRR 2204.6 [d] [3] [i]).

Moreover, the factual findings of the trial court should not be disturbed upon appeal
unless it is obvious that its conclusions could not be reached under any fair interpretation
of the [*2]evidence. This is especially true when
considering findings of fact that rest largely on the credibility of witnesses (Claridge
Gardens v Menotti, 160 AD2d 544, 544-545 [1st Dept 1990]; Nightingale Rest.
Corp. v Shak Food Corp., 155 AD2d 297 [1st Dept 1989], lv denied 76
NY2d 702 [1990]). Here, the record presents facts showing that the couple held
themselves out to society as a family unit, and that this impression was substantiated by a
caring, long term emotional, and financial commitment and interdependence (see
Braschi v Stahl Assoc. Co., 74 NY2d 201, 212-213 [1989]).
