	 The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Sterling Jones, Appellant.





Steven Banks, The Legal Aid Society, New York (Allen Fallek of counsel), for
appellant.

Cyrus R. Vance, Jr., District Attorney, New York (David P. Stromes of counsel), for
respondent.



Judgment, Supreme Court, New York County (William Leibovitz, J.), rendered
October 26, 1998, convicting defendant, after a jury trial, of murder in the second degree,
and sentencing him to a term of 25 years to life, unanimously affirmed.

The court properly exercised its discretion in denying defendant's mistrial motions
based on an improper question asked by the prosecutor of a rebuttal witness (see
People v Ortiz, 54 NY2d 288 [1981]). A mistrial was unwarranted because the
question went unanswered and the court minimized any prejudice by way of a thorough
curative instruction that the jury is presumed to have followed (see e.g. People v Otero, 56 AD3d
350 [1st Dept 2008], lv denied 14 NY3d 804 [2010]).
Concur—Sweeny, J.P., Renwick, Moskowitz, Feinman and Kapnick, JJ.
