	 The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Jamison Adsit, Appellant.





Easton Thompson Kasperek Shiffrin LLP, Rochester (Donald M. Thompson of
counsel), for defendant-appellant.

William J. Fitzpatrick, District Attorney, Syracuse (Misha A. Coulson of counsel),
for respondent.





Appeal from a judgment of the Onondaga County Court (Joseph E. Fahey, J.),
rendered August 14, 2009. The judgment convicted defendant, upon a jury verdict, of
criminal sexual act in the second degree.

It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously
affirmed.

Memorandum: On appeal from a judgment convicting him upon a jury verdict of
criminal sexual act in the second degree (Penal Law § 130.45 [2]),
defendant contends that the evidence is legally insufficient to support the conviction. We
reject that contention. Specifically, defendant contends that the evidence is legally
insufficient with respect to the issue whether the victim "is incapable of consent by
reason of being mentally disabled" (id.), which "means that [she] suffers from a
mental disease or defect which renders . . . her incapable of appraising the
nature of . . . her conduct" (§ 130.00 [5]). "An ability to
'appraise' is, of course, a qualitative matter, all the more so when the appraisal is one to
be made of the 'nature' of 'conduct[,]' with the variety of factors that the one 'appraising'
may have to take into account for such purposes. Cognitive understanding is involved. In
a case such as the one before us, it includes [the victim] being substantially able to
understand what she was doing" (People v Easley, 42 NY2d 50, 56 [1977]).

Here, the People presented the testimony of a paramedic, physician's assistant, nurse,
nursing assistant, and psychiatrist establishing that the victim had suffered a seizure and
was incoherent both upon her admission to the hospital and the next day, when the
incident giving rise to the charge occurred. The psychiatrist, who reviewed the victim's
medical records and examined her, opined that she was suffering from a mental defect
that rendered her incapable of appraising the nature of sexual activity. The defense
presented the testimony of an expert witness who conducted a forensic evaluation of the
medical, police and ambulance records and opined that the records were inconclusive
with respect to the victim's ability to appraise the nature of her sexual conduct. Viewing
the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, as we must (see People v
Contes, 60 NY2d 620, 621 [1983]), we conclude that the evidence is legally
sufficient to establish that the victim lacked the mental capacity to appraise the nature of
her sexual conduct and thus was unable to consent to defendant's actions (see People
v Dixon, 66 AD2d 971, 972 [1978]; see generally People v Cratsley, 86
NY2d 81, 86-88 [1995]; Easley, 42 NY2d at 55-57). Furthermore, viewing the
evidence in light of the elements of the crime as charged to the jury (see People v Danielson, 9
NY3d 342, 349 [2007]), we reject defendant's contention that the verdict is against
the weight of the evidence (see generally People v Bleakley, 69 NY2d 490, 495
[1987]).

Finally, we reject defendant's contention that he was denied the right to effective
assistance of counsel. The record establishes that defense counsel made a clear and
cogent opening statement directed at the People's inability to prove that the victim was
incapable of appraising the nature of her conduct, conducted meaningful
cross-examination, lodged objections consistent with the defense theory, presented the
testimony of an expert who highlighted [*2]inconsistencies in the victim's medical records with respect
to her coherency and awareness, and obtained an acquittal on the top count of the
indictment. Defense counsel's isolated comments on the paucity of DNA evidence were
not tantamount to the assertion of an inconsistent defense that no oral sexual conduct
occurred. Viewing the evidence, the law and the circumstances of this case, in totality
and as of the time of the representation, we conclude that defendant received meaningful
representation (see generally People v Baldi, 54 NY2d 137, 147 [1981]).
Present—Smith, J.P., Fahey, Whalen and DeJoseph, JJ.
