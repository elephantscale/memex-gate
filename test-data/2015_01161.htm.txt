	 Juan Carlos Pena, Also Known as Juan Carlos Pena
Batista, Appellant,
v
The Office of the Commissioner of Baseball et al.,
Respondents.





Altman & Company P.C., New York (Steven Altman of counsel), for
appellant.

Proskauer Rose LLP, New York (Adam M. Lupion of counsel), for Office of the
Commissioner of Baseball, respondent.

LeClair Ryan, New York (Madeleine Moise Cassetta of counsel), and Lorenger
& Carnell PLC, Alexandria, VA (Michael J. Lorenger of the bars of the District of
Columbia and the State of Maryland, admitted pro hac vice, of counsel), for The
Washington Nationals Baseball Club, respondent.





Order, Supreme Court, New York County (Lawrence K. Marks, J.), entered March
27, 2014, which granted defendants the Office of the Commissioner of Major League
Baseball and the Washington Nationals Baseball Club's motions to dismiss the
complaint, unanimously affirmed, without costs.

In this putative class action suit, the motion court properly concluded that plaintiff's
commencement of this action was an improper collateral attack on a prior arbitration
decision that plaintiff failed to challenge in accordance with CPLR 7511. Plaintiff was
required to file a petition challenging the determination within 90 days of receipt of the
arbitrator's decision in order to challenge the arbitration clause in the Minor League
Uniform Players' Contract (see Matter of Mavica v New York City Tr. Auth., 289
AD2d 86 [1st Dept 2001]).

Similarly, in order to challenge the arbitration clause on the ground that he was
coerced into signing the contract and agreeing to arbitration, he would have had to file a
motion to stay the arbitration (see CPLR 7503 [b]). Having failed to follow the
proper procedure, plaintiff [*2]cannot now be heard by
bringing these claims in a putative plenary class action.

We have considered plaintiff's remaining arguments and find them unavailing.
Concur—Tom, J.P., Friedman, Andrias, DeGrasse and Gische, JJ.
