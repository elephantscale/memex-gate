	 In the Matter of Milton A.,
Respondent,
v
Tracy H.A., Appellant.





Law Offices of Randall S. Carmel, Syosset (Randall S. Carmel of counsel), for
appellant.

Andrew J. Baer, New York, for respondent.





Order, Family Court, Bronx County (Paul A. Goetz, J.), entered on or about
November 13, 2013, which denied respondent mother's motion to dismiss the father's
petition for modification of an order of visitation, unanimously affirmed, without costs.
Appeal from order, entered on or about January 6, 2014, which, to the extent appealable,
denied the mother's motion to renew, unanimously dismissed, without costs, as
abandoned.

Family Court properly denied the mother's motion to dismiss the father's
modification petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, since pursuant to Domestic
Relations Law § 76-a (1), New York State maintained exclusive, continuing
jurisdiction over the prior child custody determination it made pursuant to Domestic
Relations Law § 76 (see Matter of Greenidge v Greenidge, 16 AD3d 583 [2d
Dept 2005]).

We reject the mother's argument that the July 2011 order did not expressly designate
that New York retained exclusive home state jurisdiction. Even in the absence of a
provision expressly retaining jurisdiction, the majority of courts have held that "the state
in which the initial decree was entered has exclusive continuing jurisdiction to modify
the initial decree if: (1) one of the parents continues to reside in the decree state; and (2)
the child continues to have some connection with the decree state, such as visitation" (Stocker v Sheehan, 13 AD3d
1, 7 [1st Dept 2004] [internal quotation marks and citation omitted]). The court did
not make any determination as to whether New York is an inconvenient forum. Rather, it
referred the matter to a referee to determine whether the allegations in the mother's
affidavit are sufficient to make a determination on whether the court should decline to
exercise exclusive continuing jurisdiction over the initial custody determination or
whether a hearing is required to make such a determination (see Matter of Blerim M. v Racquel
M., 41 AD3d 306 [1st Dept 2007]).

In disputed custody/visitation litigation, the interests of children should be
independently represented, and therefore, "the appointment of [an attorney for the child]
has been recognized as appropriate and helpful to the court" (Anonymous 2011-1 v Anonymous
2011-2, 102 AD3d 640, 642 [2d Dept 2013]; Koppenhoefer v
Koppenhoefer, 159 AD2d 113, 117 [2d Dept 1990]). However, the court did not err
in declining to appoint an attorney for the child, since the record [*2]established that the court only addressed the jurisdictional
issue before it and did not make any determination as to the merits of the father's petition
for modification of the July 2011 order.

No appeal lies from the denial of a motion to reargue (Espinal v City of New York,
107 AD3d 411, 412 [1st Dept 2013]). We dismiss as abandoned the mother's appeal
from that portion of the court's order denying renewal, since she failed to raise any
arguments regarding that aspect of the order on her appeal (see Cardenas v One State St.,
LLC, 68 AD3d 436, 438 [1st Dept 2009]).

We have considered the mother's remaining contentions and find them unavailing.
Concur—Sweeny, J.P., Renwick, Moskowitz, Feinman and Kapnick, JJ.
