Order of disposition, Family Court, Bronx County (Gayle P. Roberts, J.), entered on
or about May 24, 2013, insofar as it brings up for review a fact-finding determination,
same court and Judge, entered on or about May 23, 2013, which, inter alia, found that
respondent Rafael A. abused and neglected Lucy T. and that respondent mother Luz M.
neglected Lucy T., and denied petitioner's application for additional findings of child
abuse of Lucy T., against the mother, unanimously affirmed, without costs. Order of
disposition, same court and Judge, entered on or about June 4, 2013, insofar as it brings
up for review the aforementioned fact-finding determination, which, inter alia, found that
respondent mother Luz M. derivatively neglected Yolicia M., Diagenice P., Felicity M.
and Mahoganie A., and denied petitioner's applications for additional findings of
derivative child abuse of those children against respondent Luz M. and respondent
Rafael A., unanimously modified, on the law and the facts, to find that respondent Rafael
A. derivatively abused the four children, and otherwise affirmed, without costs.

Family Court properly found that respondent Rafael A., the mother's boyfriend, was
a legally responsible person who abused Lucy T., and, respectively, neglected and
derivatively neglected her and the other four children (see Matter of Yolanda D.,
88 NY2d 790, 796 [1996]). However, it should have further found that Rafael also
derivatively abused the other four children (see Matter of Christina G. [Vladimir G.], 100 AD3d 454
[1st Dept 2012], lv denied 20 NY3d 859 [2013]).

The findings of neglect and derivative neglect against both respondents with respect
to Lucy T. and the other four children were also proper. Rafael A.'s abuse of Lucy T.
while the other four children were in the room, and the mother's permitting Rafael back
into the home after learning of his abuse of Lucy T., placed all five children at risk (see Matter of Roy R., 6 AD3d
213, 213-214 [1st Dept 2004]; Matter of Taliya G. [Jeannie M.], 67 AD3d 546, 547 [1st
Dept 2009]).

However, there is no evidence that the mother abused or derivatively abused any of
her children (see Matter of
Dayanara V. [Carlos V.], 101 AD3d 411 [1st Dept 2012]).

We have considered the remaining arguments and find them unavailing.
