	 The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v
William P. Johnson, Appellant.





John A. Cirando, Syracuse, for appellant.

Mary E. Rain, District Attorney, Canton (Patricia C. Campbell, Syracuse, of
counsel), for respondent.





Peters, P.J. Appeal from a judgment of the County Court of St. Lawrence County
(Richards, J.), rendered February 15, 2013, which revoked defendant's probation and
imposed a sentence of imprisonment.

In 2006, defendant entered a guilty plea to rape in the third degree, admitting that he
subjected a 15-year-old girl to sexual intercourse when he was 34 years old, and was
sentenced to 180 days in jail with a concurrent 10-year term of probation with conditions.
Subsequently, defendant was charged with violating the condition of probation that he
not violate any laws based upon two arrests for harassment in August 2011 and January
2013 and a third harassment incident in November 2012. Defendant thereafter pleaded
guilty to violating probation related to the 2013 incident, and County Court revoked his
probation and resentenced him, as agreed, to 1 to 4 years in prison. Defendant now
appeals.

We affirm. Defendant's contention that his admission to violating probation was not
knowing, voluntary and intelligent was not raised in a postallocution motion to withdraw
his guilty plea and, thus, it is not preserved for our review (see People v McGregor, 119
AD3d 1235, 1236 [2014]; People v Cogswell, 94 AD3d 1236, 1237 [2012], lv
denied 19 NY3d 958 [2012]). Moreover, the record reflects that defendant
understood and accepted the plea terms and was advised of the rights that he was
forgoing, waived a violation hearing indicating that he had sufficient time to discuss the
matter with counsel, and thereafter voluntarily admitted to violating his probation (see People v Hare, 110 AD3d
1117, 1117 [2013]). Even assuming that one of [*2]defendant's responses to County Court's questions during
the plea colloquy cast doubt on his guilt of engaging in harassing behavior so as to
implicate the exception to the preservation requirement, as he now argues, we find that
the court's further inquiry before accepting defendant's admission ensured that his plea
was knowing, voluntary and intelligent (see People v Lopez, 71 NY2d 662,
666-667 [1988]; People v
Perez, 101 AD3d 1162, 1162 [2012]). Finally, given defendant's repeated
unwillingness to comply with the terms of his probation and his conduct in harassing
young girls and being in the presence of children without supervision when such conduct
was prohibited, we find no abuse of discretion or extraordinary circumstances warranting
a modification of the agreed-upon sentence in the interest of justice (see People v Colsten, 120
AD3d 1508, 1508 [2014]; People v McGregor, 119 AD3d at 1236).

Lahtinen, McCarthy and Lynch, JJ., concur. Ordered that the judgment is
affirmed.
