	 In the Matter of Detectives' Endowment Association,
Inc. of the Police Department of the City of New York, Respondent,
v
City of
New York et al., Appellants.





Zachary W. Carter, Corporation Counsel, New York (Kathy Chang Park of counsel),
for the City of New York and the City of New York Office of Labor Relations,
appellants.

Philip L. Maier, Office of Collective Bargaining, New York (Michael Thomas Fois
and Karine Spencer of counsel), for the New York City Board of Collective Bargaining
and Marlene Gold, appellants.

Pitta & Giblin, LLP, New York (Michael G. Dzialo of counsel), for
respondent.





Judgment, Supreme Court, New York County (Geoffrey D. Wright, J.), entered May
17, 2013, inter alia, granting the petition to annul a determination of respondent New
York City Board of Collective Bargaining (Board), dated December 20, 2011, which
denied a request for arbitration of a grievance filed by petitioner, annulling the
determination, and directing the parties to proceed to arbitration of the grievance
forthwith, unanimously reversed, on the law, without costs, the judgment vacated, the
petition denied, and the proceeding brought pursuant to CPLR article 78 dismissed.

The Board's determination finding the grievance not arbitrable due to the lack of a
reasonable relationship between the collective bargaining agreements and the claim that
the New York City Police Department improperly departed from its past practice by
paying salaries to detectives that were lower than those paid to officers (see Matter of
Board of Educ. of Watertown City School Dist. [Watertown Educ. Assn.], 93 NY2d
132, 140 [1999]), had a rational basis and was not arbitrary and capricious (Matter of
New York City Dept. of Sanitation v MacDonald, 87 NY2d 650, 656 [1996]).

Petitioner contends that its grievance alleged an "inequitable application" of the
parties' contracts, thereby satisfying the contractual definition of an arbitrable grievance,
which includes such an "inequitable application." On the contrary, petitioner's claim that
the contractually provided salary schedule improperly departed from the alleged past
practice is not "relevant to the parties' contractual rights and responsibilities," in the
absence of any contractual provision requiring the continuation of past practices as to
salaries (Matter of Chenango
Forks Cent. Sch. Dist. v New York State Pub. Empl. Relations Bd., 21 NY3d
255, 266 [2013]; see also
Matter of [*2]Good Samaritan Hosp. v 1199 Natl. Health
& Human Servs. Empls. Union, 69 AD3d 721, 722 [2d Dept 2010]). There
is no claim that the alleged past practice would have been relevant to any contractual
issue, such as the interpretation of an ambiguous provision (see Matter of Aeneas
McDonald Police Benevolent Assn. v City of Geneva, 92 NY2d 326, 332 [1998]).
