	 The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Anthony Rivera, Appellant.





Richard M. Greenberg, Office of the Appellate Defender, New York (Leila N.
Tabbaa of counsel), for appellant.

Robert T. Johnson, District Attorney, Bronx (Clara H. Salzberg of counsel), for
respondent.





Judgment, Supreme Court, Bronx County (John W. Carter, J., at suppression hearing;
Darcel D. Clark, J., at plea and sentencing), rendered April 12, 2011, convicting
defendant of manslaughter in the first degree, and sentencing him, as a second felony
offender, to a term of 11 years, unanimously affirmed.

Defendant made a valid and enforceable waiver of his right to appeal (see People v Lopez, 6 NY3d
248, 257 [2006]). The court discussed the waiver of the right to appeal in detail,
separately from its explanation of the rights that are automatically forfeited by a guilty
plea. The court accurately explained that, in addition to the previously enumerated rights,
defendant had agreed to give up the right to appeal "in exchange" for the disposition.
Thus, the court ensured that defendant understood that the right to appeal was separate
and distinct from the trial rights automatically forfeited upon pleading guilty. The court
also confirmed that defendant had discussed the waiver with defense counsel, and
defendant signed a written waiver confirming that fact.

This waiver forecloses review of defendant's suppression and excessive sentence
claims. As an alternative holding, we also reject them on the merits.
Concur—Tom, J.P., Friedman, Andrias, DeGrasse and Gische, JJ.
