	 The People of the State of New York, Respondent, v
Gordon L. Montgomery, Appellant.





Timothy P. Donaher, Public Defender, Rochester (Jane I. Yoon of counsel), for
defendant-appellant.

Sandra Doorley, District Attorney, Rochester (Christopher M. Kvam of counsel), for
respondent.





Appeal from a judgment of the Monroe County Court (Charles F. Crimi, Jr., A.J.),
rendered July 23, 2010. The judgment convicted defendant, upon a jury verdict, of
criminal possession of stolen property in the fifth degree, criminal possession of a forged
instrument in the second degree and identity theft in the first degree.

It is hereby ordered that the judgment so appealed from is unanimously
affirmed.

Memorandum: Defendant appeals from a judgment convicting him upon a jury
verdict of criminal possession of stolen property in the fifth degree (Penal Law
§ 165.40), criminal possession of a forged instrument in the second degree
(§ 170.25) and identity theft in the first degree (§ 190.80 [3]).
The conviction is based upon defendant's possession of a "convenience check" issued
against the victim's credit card account, and his use of the convenience check to purchase
merchandise. Viewing the evidence in light of the elements of the crimes as charged to
the jury (see People v
Danielson, 9 NY3d 342, 349 [2007]), we conclude that the verdict finding that
defendant was the person who committed the crimes is not against the weight of the
evidence (see generally People v Bleakley, 69 NY2d 490, 495 [1987]). The
People presented evidence that included a store surveillance video and the testimony of a
police officer familiar with defendant who identified defendant after he viewed the
video. The officer testified that he recognized defendant from his facial features and
distinctive bowlegged gait. In addition, the People presented evidence that defendant and
the victim had post office boxes at the same post office, and the jury was able to compare
the handwriting on the change of address form defendant submitted to the post office
with the handwriting on the convenience check. "[W]hile a different verdict may not
have been unreasonable, upon independently 'weigh[ing] the probative force of
conflicting testimony and the relative strength of conflicting inferences that may be
drawn from the testimony,' we conclude that the verdict is not against the weight of the
evidence" (People v Cascio,
79 AD3d 1809, 1811 [2010], lv denied 16 NY3d 893 [2011]; see People v Miller, 93 AD3d
882, 882-883 [2012], lv denied 19 NY3d 975 [2012], reconsideration
denied 20 NY3d 1063 [2013]). Present—Centra, J.P., Fahey, Lindley,
Sconiers and Whalen, JJ.
