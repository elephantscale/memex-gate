	 American Express Bank FSB,
Respondent,
v
Laila Najieb, Appellant, et al.,
Defendant.





Laila Najieb, appellant pro se.

Jaffe & Asher LLP, New York (David Joyandeh of counsel), for
respondent.





Order, Supreme Court, New York County (Joan M. Kenney, J.), entered on or about
October 8, 2013, which denied defendant Laila Najieb's (defendant) motion for summary
judgment dismissing the complaint, and granted plaintiff's cross motion for summary
judgment and to strike the answer, unanimously modified, on the law, to the extent of
denying the motion to strike the answer, vacating the direction to enter judgment on
default, and directing the Clerk to enter judgment for $24,797.86, the amount of the
account stated, as set forth in the affirmation in support of plaintiff's cross motion, and
otherwise affirmed, without costs.

The securitization of plaintiff credit card issuer's receivables did not divest it of its
ownership interest in the account, and therefore did not deprive it of standing to sue to
recover defendant's overdue credit card payments (see Citibank [South Dakota], N.A.
v Carroll, 148 Idaho 254, 257-259, 220 P3d 1073, 1076-1078 [2009]; Tostado v
Citibank [South Dakota], N.A., 2010 WL 55976, *2-3, 2010 US Dist LEXIS 228,
*5-8 [WD Tex, Jan. 4, 2010, No. SA-09-CV-549-XR]; Scott v Bank of America,
580 Fed Appx 56 [3d Cir 2014]; Shade v Bank of America, 2009 WL 5198176,
*4, 2009 US Dist LEXIS 119320, *10 [ED Cal, Dec. 23, 2009, No. 2:08-cv-1069 LKK
JFM PS], affd 2011 WL 794605, 2011 US App LEXIS 4535 [9th Cir
2011]).

Plaintiff's submission of statements that were retained by defendants for several
months without protest was sufficient to entitle plaintiff to judgment on its cause of
action for an account stated.

However, we find that the motion court improvidently exercised its discretion in
striking the answer for failure of the individual defendant to appear at a deposition
directed by a compliance conference order for a date just over one week before the
motion seeking such relief [*2]was brought. Plaintiff
failed to show that the noncompliance was willful, contumacious or in bad faith (see Amini v Arena Constr. Co.,
Inc., 110 AD3d 414 [1st Dept 2013]). Concur—Sweeny, J.P., Renwick,
Moskowitz, Feinman and Kapnick, JJ.
