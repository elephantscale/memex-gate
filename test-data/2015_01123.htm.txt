(T.)W., Appellant.

Appeal from an order of the Family Court, Jefferson County (Richard V. Hunt, J.),
entered September 25, 2013 in a proceeding pursuant to Family Court Act article 10. The
order determined that respondent had neglected her child.

It is hereby ordered that the order so appealed from is unanimously reversed on the
law without costs and the petition is dismissed.

Memorandum: In this proceeding pursuant to Family Court Act article 10,
respondent mother contends that, following a hearing, petitioner failed to establish by a
preponderance of the evidence that she neglected the subject child. We agree with the
mother, and we therefore reverse the order and dismiss the petition.

Petitioner alleged that, on May 30, 2012, the 20-year-old mother left the
11/2-year-old child in the care of the couple with whom the mother and
child lived so that the mother could take a trip to Syracuse. Petitioner alleged that the
mother did not return as planned and was not available by telephone until June 2, 2012,
when she called the couple from the State of Virginia. Petitioner further alleged that the
mother did not make an appropriate plan to care for the child during her absence and did
not return to care for the child until the police and petitioner intervened on June 5, 2012;
that while living with the couple, she went out "partying and drinking"; that she called
the child negative and derogatory names and was seen to have physically handled the
child roughly on at least one occasion; and that she had possible mental health issues. In
support of the petition, a caseworker testified at the hearing that the mother left the child
with responsible people with whom she and the child lived; that the mother admitted that
she drank alcohol but denied drinking to the point of intoxication; that the mother
admitted that she had been in therapy but denied any mental health concerns; and that the
child was removed from the mother's care based upon concerns regarding the mother's
instability, possible mental health concerns that were not treated, substance misuse, and
because she had left the child with the caregivers "with no real plan for the caregivers to
have the child for such a long time."

Both the man and woman with whom the mother and child had lived, and who the
parties stipulated were appropriate caregivers, testified with respect to their relationship
with the mother. Each of them testified that they knew where the mother was when she
went out; that she stayed out all night once or twice but she never came home
intoxicated; and that the mother never struck the child, although she was sometimes
frustrated with the child. The couple assisted the mother with child care and worked with
her on how to care for the child. The woman, a nurse, testified that, on several occasions,
the mother appeared to be overwhelmed by the child and that the mother had stated that
the couple should have custody of the child. The couple was helping the [*2]mother to "get on her feet" and encouraged her to go to
Syracuse for an employment opportunity, knowing that she would be gone for several
days. They did not know, however, that the mother would be leaving the state, and they
were concerned that they lacked any rights with respect to the child in case of a medical
emergency. The police were called because the mother's grandmother appeared at the
couple's house while the mother was away and demanded that they give her the child,
and they knew that the mother did not want her grandmother to care for the child. The
mother contacted the couple daily by telephone while she was away. The mother
conceded to the caseworker that she should not have gone to Virginia, but noted that she
was out of state for only 24 hours. At the close of petitioner's case, the mother moved to
dismiss the petition on the ground that there was no evidence that the child was harmed
by her actions or was at imminent risk of harm. The Attorney for the Child joined in the
motion to dismiss the petition, and Family Court reserved decision. The mother then
testified on her own behalf. Following the hearing, the court denied the mother's motion
to dismiss the petition and determined that the mother neglected the child.

"[A] party seeking to establish neglect must show, by a preponderance of the
evidence . . . , first, that [the] child's physical, mental or emotional condition
has been impaired or is in imminent danger of becoming impaired and second, that the
actual or threatened harm to the child is a consequence of the failure of the parent
. . . to exercise a minimum degree of care in providing the child with proper
supervision or guardianship" (Nicholson v Scoppetta, 3 NY3d 357, 368 [2004];
see Family Ct Act §§ 1012 [f] [i]; 1046 [b] [i]). "Where a
motion is made by the respondent at the close of the petitioner's case to dismiss a neglect
petition, [the court] must determine whether the petitioner presented a prima facie case of
neglect . . . , viewing the evidence in [the] light most favorable to the
petitioner and affording it the benefit of every inference which could be reasonably
drawn from the proof presented" (Matter of Christian Q., 32 AD3d 669, 670 [2006]).

We conclude that, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to petitioner, the
evidence established that the mother left the child with appropriate caregivers, who
agreed to care for the child for several days; however, she left the state for approximately
24 hours, and she failed to provide a medical authorization in case of an emergency.
Further, although the male caregiver was unable to reach the mother during the
confrontation with the mother's grandmother, petitioner's evidence established that the
mother had borrowed a telephone and had remained in contact with the caregivers each
day that she was away. The evidence also established that the mother was inexperienced
as a parent and that the couple with whom she lived was assisting her with parenting
skills and in obtaining appropriate housing, as well as medical and other benefits.

We conclude that petitioner failed to establish that, as a result of the mother's actions,
the child was in imminent danger, i.e., "near or impending [danger], not merely possible"
(Nicholson, 3 NY3d at 369). We further conclude that petitioner failed to present
any evidence connecting the mother's alleged mental health condition to any actual or
potential harm to the child (see
Matter of Joseph A. [Fausat O.], 91 AD3d 638, 640 [2012]; see also Matter of Jesus M. [Jamie
M.], 118 AD3d 1436, 1437 [2014], lv denied 24 NY3d 904 [2014]). We
therefore conclude that petitioner failed to establish by a preponderance of the evidence
that the child's physical, mental or emotional condition had been impaired or was in
imminent danger of becoming impaired as a result of the mother's failure to exercise a
minimum degree of care for the child (see Family Ct Act § 1012 [f]
[i] [A], [B]; Matter of Afton C.
[James C.], 17 NY3d 1, 8-9 [2011]; cf. Matter of Elijah NN., 66 AD3d 1157, 1159 [2009],
lv denied 13 NY3d 715 [2010]). Present—Scudder, P.J., Centra, Carni and
Sconiers, JJ.
