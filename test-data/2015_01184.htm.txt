	 The People of the State of New York,
Respondent,
v
Carlos Rodriguez, Appellant.





Robert S. Dean, Center for Appellate Litigation, New York (Molly Ryan of counsel),
for appellant.

Cyrus R. Vance, Jr., District Attorney, New York (Frank Glaser of counsel), for
respondent.





Order, Supreme Court, New York County (Ruth Pickholz, J.), entered on or about
December 10, 2012, which denied defendant's CPL 440.46 motion for resentencing,
unanimously affirmed.

The court properly exercised its discretion in determining that substantial justice
dictated the denial of defendant's motion for resentencing. Resentencing is discretionary
(People v Sosa, 18 NY3d
436, 442-443 [2012]), and courts may deny the applications of persons who "have
shown by their conduct that they do not deserve relief from their sentences" (People v Paulin, 17 NY3d
238, 244 [2011]). The mitigating factors cited by defendant are outweighed by his
extremely serious criminal history and prison disciplinary record. Defendant has been
convicted of two homicides, the second of which was committed against a fellow prison
inmate. Concur—Sweeny, J.P., Renwick, Moskowitz, Feinman and Kapnick,
JJ.
