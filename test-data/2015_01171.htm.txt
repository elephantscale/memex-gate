	 Marianne Nestor Cassini, Appellant,
v
Advance
Publications, Inc., et al., Respondents, et al., Defendants.





Reppert Kelly, LLC, New York (Christopher P. Kelly of counsel), for appellant.

Davis Wright Tremaine, LLP, New York (Elizabeth A. McNamara of counsel), for
respondents.





Order, Supreme Court, New York County (Lucy Billings, J.), entered April 19, 2013,
which granted defendants' motion to dismiss the complaint, and denied plaintiff's cross
motion pursuant to CPLR 306-b for an extension of time to serve the summons and
complaint, unanimously affirmed, without costs.

Plaintiff failed to state a cause of action for defamation based on allegedly false and
disparaging statements in an article published in the September 2010 issue of Vanity Fair
(Cassini Royale) that reports on plaintiff's secret marriage to the late designer, Oleg
Cassini, and her conduct in litigation concerning his estate. Contrary to plaintiff's
contention, the allegedly defamatory statements, including a quoted statement that
plaintiff and her sisters used to throw parties in the 1960s that were attended by many
wealthy "older guys looking for action," do not imply that plaintiff was a prostitute and
lacked sexual morals. Given the overall context in which the statements were made, a
reasonable reader would not conclude that plaintiff was a prostitute or otherwise
unchaste (see James v Gannett Co., 40 NY2d 415, 419 [1976]; Morrow v
Wiley, 73 AD2d 859 [1st Dept 1980]). Nor were the statements so "extreme and
outrageous" that they would support an action for infliction of emotional distress (see
Howell v New York Post Co., 81 NY2d 115, 121 [1993]).

Given the complaint's lack of substantive merit and plaintiff's failure to demonstrate
[*2]diligence in attempting to effect service, plaintiff
failed to meet her burden of demonstrating that either good cause or the interests of
justice support an extension of her time to serve defendants (CPLR 306-b; Leader v
Maroney, Ponzini & Spencer, 97 NY2d 95, 104 [2001]). Concur—Tom,
J.P., Friedman, Andrias, DeGrasse and Gische, JJ.
